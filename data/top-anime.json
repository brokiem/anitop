If he can travel to the island of Shinsekyo and obtain the Elixir of Life—which supposedly grants immortality—and bring it back for the shogun, then his freedom will be assured.\n\nBut of the many who have traveled to Shinsekyo in search of the mythical Elixir, not a single person has returned sound of mind, if at all.

His ultimate desire is to see his classmate Anna Yamada's beautiful face writhing in pain before he ends her life. But this fantasy may never come to fruition, as Ichikawa starts to see an entirely different side to Yamada.\n\nOften seeking refuge in the library, Ichikawa frequently runs into Yamada. It is during these encounters that Ichikawa realizes his model classmate is actually an airhead who can never read the room. As they spend more time together, the boy cannot help but feel not only a sense of endearment toward the very girl he wishes to murder but also a desire to protect her at all costs. Is it possible that this sudden change in Ichikawa's perspective could lead to something more?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1886/131654.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/182379/Anna_Yamada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/485465.jpg","name":"Yamada, Anna","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/53824/Hina_Youmiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62749.jpg","name":"Youmiya, Hina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/185229/Kyoutarou_Ichikawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/486855.jpg","name":"Ichikawa, Kyoutarou","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39133/Shun_Horie","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62621.jpg","name":"Horie, Shun"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/195899/Kana_Ichikawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/440240.jpg","name":"Ichikawa, Kana","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/27/Yukari_Tamura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54665.jpg","name":"Tamura, Yukari"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/195862/Moeko_Sekine","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/502750.jpg","name":"Sekine, Moeko","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/12961/Megumi_Han","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/72566.jpg","name":"Han, Megumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/224298/Honoka_Hara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/503556.jpg","name":"Hara, Honoka","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/599/Aki_Toyosaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67015.jpg","name":"Toyosaki, Aki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/195859/Chihiro_Kobayashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/449837.jpg","name":"Kobayashi, Chihiro","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/25773/Ayaka_Asai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/60997.jpg","name":"Asai, Ayaka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/195898/Serina_Yoshida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/503557.jpg","name":"Yoshida, Serina","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17215/Atsumi_Tanezaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/61243.jpg","name":"Tanezaki, Atsumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/230024/Ichikawa_039_s_Mother","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/511934.jpg","name":"Ichikawa's Mother","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/553/Chinami_Nishimura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54470.jpg","name":"Nishimura, Chinami"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/228468/Rin_Kanaoya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/509808.jpg","name":"Kanaoya, Rin","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21515/Yuu_Serizawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/74168.jpg","name":"Serizawa, Yuu"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/230025/Yamada_039_s_Mother","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/511935.jpg","name":"Yamada's Mother","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/170/Yuko_Minaguchi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/56381.jpg","name":"Minaguchi, Yuko"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/65044/Yuuko_Matsui","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Matsui, Yuuko","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63601/Akihiro_Sotokawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Sotokawa, Akihiro","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/49153/Hiroaki_Akagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/56608.jpg","name":"Akagi, Hiroaki","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/64457/Noriyoshi_Konuma","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Konuma, Noriyoshi","role":"Sound Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1x6BnBAOwaY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"The Dangers in My Heart","japaneseTitle":"僕の心のヤバイやつ","synonyms":["Bokuyaba"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Apr 2, 2023 to Jun 18, 2023","premiered":"Spring 2023","broadcast":"Sundays at 01:30 (JST)","producers":["Dentsu","TV Asahi","Movic","Magic Capsule","Avex Pictures","Akita Shoten","BS Asahi","TV Asahi Music"],"studios":["Shin-Ei Animation"],"source":"Manga","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

Those unable to practice magic are swiftly exterminated to maintain the magical integrity of society. However, deep within a forest lies an anomaly in Mash Burnedead, who can be found pumping iron with one arm and lifting a cream puff with the other. This aloof boy with superhuman strength—but no magical abilities—leads a quiet life with his father, far removed from society.\n\nMash's peace is soon disturbed when the authorities discover his lack of magical powers. They issue him an ultimatum: compete to become a \"Divine Visionary,\" which would force everyone to accept him, or be persecuted forever.

Orchestra","synopsis":"Hajime Aono used to live for the sound of his violin playing. Ever since he was young, he had admired his world-renowned violinist father, who inspired him to pick up the instrument himself. But following his parents' bitter divorce, Aono swears to never play again and heads for high school without a direction or a prospect.\n\nDuring a physical education class, the unathletic Aono gets struck in the face with a ball and ends up in the infirmary. There, he meets the brash Ritsuko Akine who begins to play the violin in the room, believing she is alone. However, following a past incident, there have been rumors claiming that Akine is a bully, which has isolated her from her peers—a fact Aono was unaware of.\n\nAkine dreams of enrolling in a school with an orchestra, but her amateurish playing and lack of musical knowledge grates on Aono immensely. Seeing this as a perfect opportunity for the two to become friends, their teacher suggests that Aono teaches Akine how to play the violin, something Aono is vehemently against. However, as the pair spends more time together, they soon learn to understand and help each other—and Aono may finally discover the lost passion and melody in his life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1832/133754.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/172876/Ritsuko_Akine","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/504218.jpg","name":"Akine, Ritsuko","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/18511/Ai_Kakuma","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65855.jpg","name":"Kakuma, Ai"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/184285/Hajime_Aono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/509470.jpg","name":"Aono, Hajime","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37562/Shouya_Chiba","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/74244.jpg","name":"Chiba, Shouya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/172873/Haru_Kozakura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/504217.jpg","name":"Kozakura, Haru","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/50226/Minako_Satou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/74092.jpg","name":"Satou, Minako"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/172875/Nao_Saeki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/504219.jpg","name":"Saeki, Nao","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/41648/Shinba_Tsuchiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/71102.jpg","name":"Tsuchiya, Shinba"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/172878/Ichiro_Yamada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/504215.jpg","name":"Yamada, Ichiro","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17635/Makoto_Furukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/74503.jpg","name":"Furukawa, Makoto"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/227579/Takeda-sensei","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/508194.jpg","name":"Takeda-sensei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/48682/Hayato_Kaneko","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54246.jpg","name":"Kaneko, Hayato"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/172877/Sou_Harada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/504213.jpg","name":"Harada, Sou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/30853/Junya_Enoki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62840.jpg","name":"Enoki, Junya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/225443/Ryuuji_Aono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/504212.jpg","name":"Aono, Ryuuji","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/177/Ryoutarou_Okiayu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/55010.jpg","name":"Okiayu, Ryoutarou"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/209080/Mari_Tateishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/508195.jpg","name":"Tateishi, Mari","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/43279/Konomi_Kohara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/70597.jpg","name":"Kohara, Konomi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/227580/Hiroaki_Ayukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/508192.jpg","name":"Ayukawa, Hiroaki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/212/Daisuke_Ono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54593.jpg","name":"Ono, Daisuke"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6909/Seiji_Kishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/49711.jpg","name":"Kishi, Seiji","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/35787/Satoki_Iida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/49710.jpg","name":"Iida, Satoki","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/15655/Yuuko_Kakihara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/70327.jpg","name":"Kakihara, Yuuko","role":"Script, Series Composition"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/52671/Akira_Kosemura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/61144.jpg","name":"Kosemura, Akira","role":"Music"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4jcYv08oyw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Blue Orchestra","japaneseTitle":"青のオーケストラ","synonyms":["The Blue Orchestra"],"type":"TV","episodes":"24","aired":"Apr 9, 2023 to ?","premiered":"Spring 2023","broadcast":"Sundays at 17:00 (JST)","producers":["NHK","NHK Enterprises"],"studios":["Nippon Animation"],"source":"Web manga","duration":"25 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

Once the war ended, an annual tradition was proposed where a female sacrifice would be taken from the humans to be eaten by the King of Beasts. This tradition continues on as the 99th sacrifice, 15-year-old Sariphi, is taken from her village to the kingdom of Ozmargo, a miasma-filled realm where beasts live and human entry is forbidden.\n\nBut Sariphi is not like the previous sacrifices. Her optimism and lack of fear towards the beasts and her fate surprises the otherwise fearsome King. Intrigued by the sacrificial princess and her history, he allows her to freely roam around the kingdom until the night of revelation despite the potential outrage. Little do Sariphi and the King know, their short time spent together has slowly set the stage for something unimaginably different for the future of Ozmargo.\n\n[Written by MAL

Thanks to the legendary hero Shion Bladearts, wielder of Excalibur, and his loyal band of companions, the Gate was sealed off and the demonic threat was vanquished.\n\nUnfortunately, the seal was incomplete and has begun to weaken, allowing the demons to once again begin their attack. Worried about the safety of his village, selfish and perverted farmer Touka Scott dig pitfalls to defend against the demons. But fear not, for Shion is on his way to reseal Hell's Gate and save humanity!\n\nOr at least he was, because the legendary hero is dead, having fallen into one of the pitfalls Touka dug. Luckily, dealing with the dead is the specialty of necromancer Anri Haynesworth. While she can't revive him, Anri can at least salvage their quest by forcing Touka's soul into Shion's rotting body and dragging him along to Hell's Gate in Shion's place. Not wanting to be left behind, Touka's childhood friend Yuna Yunis tags along. Together, the three of them set out as what just might be the most unsuitable party to ever try to save the world!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1868/133866.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/124110/Touka_Scott","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/496888.jpg","name":"Scott, Touka","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/38176/Shunichi_Toki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/60590.jpg","name":"Toki, Shunichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/124171/Anri_Hazeworth","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/496889.jpg","name":"Hazeworth, Anri","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62976.jpg","name":"Taketatsu, Ayana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/124172/Yuna_Yunis","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/496890.jpg","name":"Yunis, Yuna","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/12750/Hibiku_Yamamura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/73877.jpg","name":"Yamamura, Hibiku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/169658/Marguerit_Farom","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/496893.jpg","name":"Farom, Marguerit","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17209/Yurika_Kubo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69339.jpg","name":"Kubo, Yurika"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/124109/Kyle_Osment","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/496897.jpg","name":"Osment, Kyle","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/513/Yuuichi_Nakamura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/74056.jpg","name":"Nakamura, Yuuichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/169660/Dorothy_Eleonora","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/377282.jpg","name":"Eleonora, Dorothy","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/145015/Sion_Breydan","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/496891.jpg","name":"Breydan, Sion","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/38176/Shunichi_Toki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/60590.jpg","name":"Toki, Shunichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/225644/Ethel_Borgnine","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/504472.jpg","name":"Borgnine, Ethel","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/92/Sayaka_Ohara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54698.jpg","name":"Ohara, Sayaka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/154822/Leland_Tolman","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/504477.jpg","name":"Tolman, Leland","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/34615/Chikahiro_Kobayashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/74584.jpg","name":"Kobayashi, Chikahiro"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/225646/Isaac_Gardner","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/504474.jpg","name":"Gardner, Isaac","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/4252/Takashi_Aoki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/70644.jpg","name":"Aoki, Takashi"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/64546/Hisato_Usui","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Usui, Hisato","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/7004/Rion_Kujou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Kujou, Rion","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/20919/Youji_Shimizu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/47158.jpg","name":"Shimizu, Youji","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17209/Yurika_Kubo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69339.jpg","name":"Kubo, Yurika","role":"Theme Song Performance"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ApTw19ZTQg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"The Legendary Hero Is Dead!","japaneseTitle":"勇者が死んだ！","synonyms":["The Hero Is Dead!"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Apr 7, 2023 to ?","premiered":"Spring 2023","broadcast":"Fridays at 01:00 (JST)","producers":["Pony Canyon","Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","Shogakukan","Crunchyroll","WOWMAX"],"studios":["LIDENFILMS"],"source":"Web manga","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

This good deed allows him to be reborn with all his memories in another world as Cain von Silford, the third son of a margrave.\n\nWhen Cain turns five, a baptismal ceremony in the church grants him an audience to the seven gods who preside over the world. Not only do the gods fill him in on the circumstances of his reincarnation, but they also give Cain their respective divine protections—allowing him to use cheat-like abilities in swordsmanship, magic, and many other aspects.\n\nWith these blessings, Cain sets out to live a fulfilling life that he deems a dream come true.

Shoujo Magical Destroyers","synopsis":"In 2008, the Japanese government began hunting people who identify as otaku in an effort to protect the country's culture. In just one week, the enforcement agency known as the SSC captured almost every otaku by force and confiscated their memorabilia. One passionate man calling himself Otaku Hero refuses to allow this agency to do as they please: he raises a resistance army made up of other displaced geeks who band together to help defend their culture.\n\nThree years later, the fires of rebellion wane as all hope seems lost for otakus. Spurred on by his ally—the magical girl Anarchy—Otaku Hero commands the resistance in an effort to reunite Anarchy with the other two other magical girls: Blue and Pink. By combining the power of this trio, the resistance may be able to defeat the SSC and save otaku culture for everyone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1203/134079.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/217568/Anarchy","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/504384.jpg","name":"Anarchy","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/49011/Ai_Fairouz","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65931.jpg","name":"Fairouz, Ai"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/217569/Blue","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/504331.jpg","name":"Blue","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/14519/Aimi_Terakawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/64082.jpg","name":"Terakawa, Aimi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/217570/Pink","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/504332.jpg","name":"Pink","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11661/Tomoyo_Kurosawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/69995.jpg","name":"Kurosawa, Tomoyo"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/217567/Otaku_Hero","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/504383.jpg","name":"Otaku Hero","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17635/Makoto_Furukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/74503.jpg","name":"Furukawa, Makoto"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/225146/Slayer","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/503583.jpg","name":"Slayer","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21515/Yuu_Serizawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/74168.jpg","name":"Serizawa, Yuu"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/228278/Itasha_Driver","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/509529.jpg","name":"Itasha Driver","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/257/Nobuyuki_Hiyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/10862.jpg","name":"Hiyama, Nobuyuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/225145/Kyotaro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/504333.jpg","name":"Kyotaro","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/46249/Tomori_Kusunoki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/74544.jpg","name":"Kusunoki, Tomori"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/229175/Marcus","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/510745.jpg","name":"Marcus","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/720/Kenta_Miyake","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/42617.jpg","name":"Miyake, Kenta"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/225467/Pro-Wrestling_Otaku","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/504223.jpg","name":"Pro-Wrestling Otaku","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/10148/Shinya_Takahashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/43051.jpg","name":"Takahashi, Shinya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/228277/Gou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/509528.jpg","name":"@Gou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1764/Kouki_Uchiyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63405.jpg","name":"Uchiyama, Kouki"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/28575/Ikehata_Hiroshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/41766.jpg","name":"Hiroshi, Ikehata","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6549/Satoshi_Motoyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Motoyama, Satoshi","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/48078/Taiki_Konno","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/52697.jpg","name":"Konno, Taiki","role":"Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21007/Kenichi_Kutsuna","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/23797.jpg","name":"Kutsuna, Kenichi","role":"Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation, Animation Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5IOhCXBDH_g?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Magical Destroyers","japaneseTitle":"魔法少女マジカルデストロイヤーズ","synonyms":["Magical Girl Magical Destroyers","MagiDes"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Apr 8, 2023 to ?","premiered":"Spring 2023","broadcast":"Saturdays at 01:55 (JST)","producers":["Mainichi Broadcasting System","King Records","Bit grooove promotion","Sankyo"],"studios":["Bibury Animation Studios"],"source":"Original","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

As humans who have undergone surgery in order to make use of the special abilities of ghouls, they participate in operations to eradicate the dangerous creatures. The leader of this group, Haise Sasaki, is a half-ghoul, half-human who has been trained by famed special class investigator, Kishou Arima.
