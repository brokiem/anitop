[{"title":"Psycho-Pass Movie","synopsis":"Due to the incredible success of the Sibyl System, Japan has begun exporting the technology to other countries with the hope that it will one day be used all around the world. In order to test its effectiveness in a foreign location, the war-torn state of the South East Asian Union (SEAUn) decides to implement the system, hoping to bring peace and stability to the town of Shambala Float and keep the population in check.\n\nHowever, a group of anti-Sibyl terrorists arrive in Japan, and the Ministry of Welfare's Public Safety Bureau discovers significant evidence that the invaders are being aided by Shinya Kougami, a former Enforcer who went rogue. Because of their past relationship, Akane Tsunemori is sent to SEAUn to bring him back, but with their last meeting years in the past, their reunion might not go quite as planned.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/71793.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/68315/Shinya_Kougami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/458989.jpg","name":"Kougami, Shinya","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1/Tomokazu_Seki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/55486.jpg","name":"Seki, Tomokazu"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/68583/Akane_Tsunemori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/179601.jpg","name":"Tsunemori, Akane","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69318.jpg","name":"Hanazawa, Kana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/69725/Shougo_Makishima","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/192519.jpg","name":"Makishima, Shougo","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/79/Takahiro_Sakurai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62791.jpg","name":"Sakurai, Takahiro"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/69057/Nobuchika_Ginoza","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/198005.jpg","name":"Ginoza, Nobuchika","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/74/Kenji_Nojima","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/46155.jpg","name":"Nojima, Kenji"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/69063/Shion_Karanomori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/198337.jpg","name":"Karanomori, Shion","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/99/Miyuki_Sawashiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65500.jpg","name":"Sawashiro, Miyuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/69059/Yayoi_Kunizuka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/179609.jpg","name":"Kunizuka, Yayoi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/93/Shizuka_Itou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54675.jpg","name":"Itou, Shizuka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/120845/Dominator","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/272513.jpg","name":"Dominator","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/181/Noriko_Hidaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/53079.jpg","name":"Hidaka, Noriko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/75206/Jouji_Saiga","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/204879.jpg","name":"Saiga, Jouji","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6755/Kazuhiro_Yamaji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62790.jpg","name":"Yamaji, Kazuhiro"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/113595/Shou_Hinakawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/262443.jpg","name":"Hinakawa, Shou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/79/Takahiro_Sakurai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62791.jpg","name":"Sakurai, Takahiro"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/74011/Mika_Shimotsuki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/392313.jpg","name":"Shimotsuki, Mika","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11622/Ayane_Sakura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67809.jpg","name":"Sakura, Ayane"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/49895/Fumi_Morihiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Morihiro, Fumi","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/9903/Rui_Kuroki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62475.jpg","name":"Kuroki, Rui","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/49893/Akitoshi_Mori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69460.jpg","name":"Mori, Akitoshi","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/52145/Hiroaki_Matsuura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/71043.jpg","name":"Matsuura, Hiroaki","role":"Producer"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GY36cxjaN9I?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Psycho-Pass: The Movie","japaneseTitle":"劇場版 サイコパス","synonyms":["Psychopath Movie"],"type":"Movie","episodes":"1","aired":"Jan 9, 2015","premiered":"","broadcast":"","producers":["Dentsu","Fuji TV","Nitroplus","Sony Music Entertainment","TOHO animation","Kyoraku Industrial Holdings"],"studios":["Production I.G"],"source":"Original","duration":"1 hr. 53 min.","rating":"R -

But an act of greedy betrayal by the yakuza leads to Denji's brutal, untimely death, crushing all hope of him ever achieving happiness.\n\nRemarkably, an old contract allows Pochita to merge with the deceased Denji and bestow devil powers on him, changing him into a hybrid able to transform his body parts into chainsaws.

This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.\n\nBut instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world—one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker \"Shadow\" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1874/121869.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/171572/Cid_Kagenou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/461218.jpg","name":"Kagenou, Cid","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/23249/Seiichirou_Yamashita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/41764.jpg","name":"Yamashita, Seiichirou"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194185/Delta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/483020.jpg","name":"Delta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/49011/Ai_Fairouz","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65931.jpg","name":"Fairouz, Ai"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194178/Alpha","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/491824.jpg","name":"Alpha","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11787/Asami_Seto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65840.jpg","name":"Seto, Asami"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194179/Beta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/491826.jpg","name":"Beta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/65498.jpg","name":"Minase, Inori"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194192/Claire_Kagenou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/486844.jpg","name":"Kagenou, Claire","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/5250/Rina_Hidaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/64321.jpg","name":"Hidaka, Rina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194186/Epsilon","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/483024.jpg","name":"Epsilon","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8555/Hisako_Kanemoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/53110.jpg","name":"Kanemoto, Hisako"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194180/Gamma","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/483023.jpg","name":"Gamma","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11359/Suzuko_Mimori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73413.jpg","name":"Mimori, Suzuko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/206345/Zeta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/483019.jpg","name":"Zeta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/25773/Ayaka_Asai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/60997.jpg","name":"Asai, Ayaka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/206346/Eta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/483018.jpg","name":"Eta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/33795/Reina_Kondou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69580.jpg","name":"Kondou, Reina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194194/Alexia_Midgar","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/499326.jpg","name":"Midgar, Alexia","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69318.jpg","name":"Hanazawa, Kana"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63590/Shouta_Watase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Watase, Shouta","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/55494/Kazuya_Nakanishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Nakanishi, Kazuya","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8074/Jin_Aketagawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/53380.jpg","name":"Aketagawa, Jin","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/42034/Daisuke_Takashima","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Takashima, Daisuke","role":"Episode Director, Storyboard"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-3fre7943U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"The Eminence in Shadow","japaneseTitle":"陰の実力者になりたくて！","synonyms":["Shadow Garden"],"type":"TV","episodes":"20","aired":"Oct 5, 2022 to ?","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Wednesdays at 22:30 (JST)","producers":["AT-X","BS NTV","Kadokawa","NewGin","Aiming"],"studios":["Nexus"],"source":"Light novel","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"R -

Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1258/126929.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178716/Meguru_Bachira","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/498284.jpg","name":"Bachira, Meguru","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/55082/Tasuku_Kaito","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/64773.jpg","name":"Kaito, Tasuku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/177491/Yoichi_Isagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/498285.jpg","name":"Isagi, Yoichi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/52590/Kazuki_Ura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61058.jpg","name":"Ura, Kazuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178712/Hyouma_Chigiri","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/498286.jpg","name":"Chigiri, Hyouma","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/18227/Souma_Saitou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/52218.jpg","name":"Saitou, Souma"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178718/Rensuke_Kunigami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/498283.jpg","name":"Kunigami, Rensuke","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1154/Yuuki_Ono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62831.jpg","name":"Ono, Yuuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178722/Seishirou_Nagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/498287.jpg","name":"Nagi, Seishirou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/10989/Nobunaga_Shimazaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/70961.jpg","name":"Shimazaki, Nobunaga"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/188026/Rin_Itoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/498288.jpg","name":"Itoshi, Rin","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1764/Kouki_Uchiyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63405.jpg","name":"Uchiyama, Kouki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178723/Shouei_Barou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/498289.jpg","name":"Barou, Shouei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/95/Junichi_Suwabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/66059.jpg","name":"Suwabe, Junichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178719/Reo_Mikage","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/498290.jpg","name":"Mikage, Reo","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/33995/Yuuma_Uchida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/71413.jpg","name":"Uchida, Yuuma"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178715/Jinpachi_Ego","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/498291.jpg","name":"Ego, Jinpachi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/118/Hiroshi_Kamiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66163.jpg","name":"Kamiya, Hiroshi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178721/Sae_Itoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/498292.jpg","name":"Itoshi, Sae","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/79/Takahiro_Sakurai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62791.jpg","name":"Sakurai, Takahiro"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63582/Makoto_Furukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Furukawa, Makoto","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/53860/Tetsuaki_Watanabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Watanabe, Tetsuaki","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37118/Fumiyuki_Gou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63242.jpg","name":"Gou, Fumiyuki","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/62538/Masao_Kawase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Kawase, Masao","role":"Episode Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4V_e3iRxds?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Blue Lock","japaneseTitle":"ブルーロック","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"24","aired":"Oct 9, 2022 to ?","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Sundays at 01:30 (JST)","producers":["TV Asahi","Kodansha","Toy's Factory","Crunchyroll","Bandai Spirits","Bit grooove promotion","Bandai Namco Filmworks","Bandai Namco Music Live"],"studios":["8bit"],"source":"Manga","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/117909/Izuku_Midoriya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/299404.jpg","name":"Midoriya, Izuku","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21971/Daiki_Yamashita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/57424.jpg","name":"Yamashita, Daiki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/117911/Katsuki_Bakugou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/299406.jpg","name":"Bakugou, Katsuki","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/270/Nobuhiko_Okamoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/48785.jpg","name":"Okamoto, Nobuhiko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/117921/All_Might","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/310613.jpg","name":"All Might","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/720/Kenta_Miyake","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/42617.jpg","name":"Miyake, Kenta"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/117917/Ochako_Uraraka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/299421.jpg","name":"Uraraka, Ochako","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11622/Ayane_Sakura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67809.jpg","name":"Sakura, Ayane"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/117913/Tenya_Iida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/299418.jpg","name":"Iida, Tenya","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/20156/Kaito_Ishikawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/57127.jpg","name":"Ishikawa, Kaito"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/118489/Shouto_Todoroki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/332527.jpg","name":"Todoroki, Shouto","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuuki_Kaji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/66416.jpg","name":"Kaji, Yuuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/117915/Shouta_Aizawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/301855.jpg","name":"Aizawa, Shouta","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/95/Junichi_Suwabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/66059.jpg","name":"Suwabe, Junichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/118487/Eijirou_Kirishima","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/329529.jpg","name":"Kirishima, Eijirou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/12017/Toshiki_Masuda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/60807.jpg","name":"Masuda, Toshiki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/119209/Tsuyu_Asui","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/299409.jpg","name":"Asui, Tsuyu","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67808.jpg","name":"Yuuki, Aoi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/122103/Tomura_Shigaraki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/272139.jpg","name":"Shigaraki, Tomura","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1764/Kouki_Uchiyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63405.jpg","name":"Uchiyama, Kouki"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/62438/Naoki_Amano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/72898.jpg","name":"Amano, Naoki","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/13677/Kenji_Nagasaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/43068.jpg","name":"Nagasaki, Kenji","role":"Director, Storyboard"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/16749/Masafumi_Mima","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/54386.jpg","name":"Mima, Masafumi","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/59892/Hakuyu_Go","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Go, Hakuyu","role":"Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5fYOnwYkj4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"My Hero Academia","japaneseTitle":"僕のヒーローアカデミア","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"13","aired":"Apr 3, 2016 to Jun 26, 2016","premiered":"Spring 2016","broadcast":"Sundays at 17:00 (JST)","producers":["Dentsu","Mainichi Broadcasting System","Movic","TOHO animation","Shueisha"],"studios":["Bones"],"source":"Manga","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

As a result, schools have begun incorporating these technologies into their curriculum, leaving behind the ways of the old. One such institution is the elite Yuyu Girls' Vocational High School, where both Serufu Yua and her childhood friend, Miku \"Purin\" Suride, have applied. Although the tech-savvy Purin is accepted to Yuyu High, the accident-prone Serufu is rejected and enters the traditional Gatagata Girls' High School instead, driving a wedge into their friendship.\n\nOn her way to class one day, Serufu gets into a bike accident, and Rei Yasaku, a passerby who attends the same school, fixes her damaged bicycle. Serufu later finds out that Rei has a passion for old-fashioned crafts and is the head of the school's Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Club—which is in danger of closing due to a lack of members.\n\nRealizing that this may be her chance to repair her relationship with Purin, Serufu joins the club in hopes of creating projects that could bring them together once more. As the DIY Club welcomes new faces, Serufu learns to build not only handicrafts but also new friendships along the way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1408/127129.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194642/Serufu_Yua","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/493798.jpg","name":"Yua, Serufu","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/57409/Konomi_Inagaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/68875.jpg","name":"Inagaki, Konomi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194639/Juliet_Queen_Elizabeth_VIII","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/493799.jpg","name":"Juliet Queen Elizabeth VIII","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/31509/Nichika_Oomori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/66811.jpg","name":"Oomori, Nichika"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194643/Kokoro_Kouki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/493797.jpg","name":"Kouki, Kokoro","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/26541/Karin_Takahashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/56328.jpg","name":"Takahashi, Karin"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194641/Miku_Suride","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/493219.jpg","name":"Suride, Miku","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47097/Kana_Ichinose","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/70398.jpg","name":"Ichinose, Kana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194640/Rei_Yasaku","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/492338.jpg","name":"Yasaku, Rei","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11622/Ayane_Sakura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67809.jpg","name":"Sakura, Ayane"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194644/Takumi_Hikage","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/494674.jpg","name":"Hikage, Takumi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/36812/Azumi_Waki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62975.jpg","name":"Waki, Azumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/218488/Serufu_039_s_Mother","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/490019.jpg","name":"Serufu's Mother","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/195/Kikuko_Inoue","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69603.jpg","name":"Inoue, Kikuko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/215889/Haruko_Hoketsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/489910.jpg","name":"Hoketsu, Haruko","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/298/Yumi_Kakazu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/53617.jpg","name":"Kakazu, Yumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/218532/Kurage-san","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/490052.jpg","name":"Kurage-san","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/936/Hozumi_Gouda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/72327.jpg","name":"Gouda, Hozumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/222078/Kurei_039_s_Mother","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/497525.jpg","name":"Kurei's Mother","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47221/Wakana_Kowaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/51138.jpg","name":"Kowaka, Wakana"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63456/Tomoyuki_Oowada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73389.jpg","name":"Oowada, Tomoyuki","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63590/Shouta_Watase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Watase, Shouta","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63675/Kazuyoshi_Mukaitouge","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Mukaitouge, Kazuyoshi","role":"Producer, Planning"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/36904/Kazuhiro_Yoneda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Yoneda, Kazuhiro","role":"Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxRszOIy9eA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Do It Yourself!!","japaneseTitle":"Do It Yourself!!

Residing in her jet-black palace and isolated from the emperor, she is the subject of countless rumors. Claimed to possess mystic abilities, she is said to take on any request—from finding lost items to inflicting curses. While some call her an immortal sage, others believe her to be a terrifying revenant. But such comments fail to faze Jusetsu, who prefers to spend her days in quiet solitude. That is, until the emperor, Ka Koushun, barges into her court and asks for her assistance with a mysterious case.\n\nThe young emperor's request requires Jusetsu to step out of her palace for the first time. Despite Ka Koushun's frequent visits annoying her to no end, she cannot bring herself to turn him away. Her predecessor's teachings echo in her ears: the Raven Consort is destined to remain forever alone and never desire anything. Yet Jusetsu finds herself making the first of several bonds when she asks Jiujiu, an innocently inquisitive court girl, to be her sole attendant.\n\nTogether, they begin fulfilling requests from the people of the palace. However, unknown perils lurk in the outside world, and drawing attention to herself may bring Jusetsu face-to-face with a past that is better left undisturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1932/127228.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/209541/Jusetsu_Ryuu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/480376.jpg","name":"Ryuu, Jusetsu","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/53810/Saku_Mizuno","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62745.jpg","name":"Mizuno, Saku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/209520/Koushun_Ka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/485404.jpg","name":"Ka, Koushun","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/41752/Masaaki_Mizunaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/71149.jpg","name":"Mizunaka, Masaaki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/209543/Jiujiu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/480373.jpg","name":"Jiujiu","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/35441/Marika_Kouno","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/60990.jpg","name":"Kouno, Marika"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/216022/Kai_Tan","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/485400.jpg","name":"Tan, Kai","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/270/Nobuhiko_Okamoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/48785.jpg","name":"Okamoto, Nobuhiko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/209542/Sei_Ei","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/480374.jpg","name":"Ei, Sei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/38359/Taku_Yashiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61056.jpg","name":"Yashiro, Taku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/216021/Kei_On","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/485399.jpg","name":"On, Kei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/10989/Nobunaga_Shimazaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/70961.jpg","name":"Shimazaki, Nobunaga"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/219538/Han","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/491962.jpg","name":"Han","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/45452/Yuka_Nukui","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/48854.jpg","name":"Nukui, Yuka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/217249/Ishiha","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/489702.jpg","name":"Ishiha","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/9789/Mana_Hirata","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/60779.jpg","name":"Hirata, Mana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/220786/Keiran_An","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/494889.jpg","name":"An, Keiran","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8/Rie_Kugimiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63374.jpg","name":"Kugimiya, Rie"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/220785/Enrin_Sai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Sai, Enrin","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8/Rie_Kugimiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63374.jpg","name":"Kugimiya, Rie"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37604/Chizuru_Miyawaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/64579.jpg","name":"Miyawaki, Chizuru","role":"Director, Setting"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8074/Jin_Aketagawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/53380.jpg","name":"Aketagawa, Jin","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/48028/Ziyoou-vachi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54180.jpg","name":"Ziyoou-vachi","role":"Theme Song Performance"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47551/Avu-chan","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/55988.jpg","name":"Avu-chan","role":"Theme Song Lyrics"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/quAPsQrxKCE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Raven of the Inner Palace","japaneseTitle":"後宮の烏","synonyms":["Kokyu no Karasu"],"type":"TV","episodes":"13","aired":"Oct 1, 2022 to Dec 24, 2022","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)","producers":["Aniplex","Movic","Shueisha","Kansai Telecasting","BS11","Tohan Corporation","Marui Group"],"studios":["Bandai Namco Pictures"],"source":"Light novel","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

At any rate, whenever Uzaki wants to hang out with her upperclassman, fun and adorable wackiness is sure to follow!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1540/108292.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/167031/Hana_Uzaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/371829.jpg","name":"Uzaki, Hana","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/22329/Naomi_Oozora","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/68410.jpg","name":"Oozora, Naomi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/167360/Shinichi_Sakurai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/409778.jpg","name":"Sakurai, Shinichi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/7512/Kenji_Akabane","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/71097.jpg","name":"Akabane, Kenji"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/187032/Tsuki_Uzaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/423921.jpg","name":"Uzaki, Tsuki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/869/Saori_Hayami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/73488.jpg","name":"Hayami, Saori"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178037/Ami_Asai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/488688.jpg","name":"Asai, Ami","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/68581.jpg","name":"Taketatsu, Ayana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/185578/Akihiko_Asai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/497120.jpg","name":"Asai, Akihiko","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/634/Yousuke_Akimoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54969.jpg","name":"Akimoto, Yousuke"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178038/Itsuhito_Sakaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/409779.jpg","name":"Sakaki, Itsuhito","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/50563/Tomoya_Takagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/58300.jpg","name":"Takagi, Tomoya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/186953/Kiri_Uzaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/424369.jpg","name":"Uzaki, Kiri","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/407/Yuuko_Sanpei","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/72329.jpg","name":"Sanpei, Yuuko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/218074/Narrator","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Narrator","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/12621/Shinichi_Yamada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/12573.jpg","name":"Yamada, Shinichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/218076/Miho_Miho","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/489232.jpg","name":"Miho Miho","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/215843/Ramen_Restaurant_Owner","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/485010.jpg","name":"Ramen Restaurant Owner","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63679/Noritomo_Isogai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Isogai, Noritomo","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/30381/Kazuya_Miura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/59135.jpg","name":"Miura, Kazuya","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8110/Yasunori_Ebina","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/43008.jpg","name":"Ebina, Yasunori","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/51635/Fumio_Itou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Itou, Fumio","role":"Episode Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBvd29TjxYw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!","japaneseTitle":"宇崎ちゃんは遊びたい！","synonyms":["Uzaki-chan Wants to Play!"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jul 10, 2020 to Sep 25, 2020","premiered":"Summer 2020","broadcast":"Fridays at 21:30 (JST)","producers":["Movic","AT-X","Enterbrain","Sammy","ABC Animation","Kadokawa Media House","Kadokawa","INCS toenter","IMAGICA Lab."],"studios":["ENGI"],"source":"Manga","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

To prevent her predetermined demise, Aileen has only one option: to court the game's last boss, Claude Jeanne Elmir—the proclaimed \"Demon King\" and Cedric's half-brother—and marry him.\n\nHowever, it is easier said than done, as Claude distrusts her intentions.

Kousetsu constantly follows and observes him with no regard for his privacy, focusing only on keeping him safe every waking moment. But the consistent hounding starts making sense when an adorable second-year student at his high school, Satomi Tsubaki, asks Ittoki out on a date. Though initially innocent, Tsubaki's true intentions soon become apparent when Ittoki visits her house; she plans to assassinate him, and she is not alone. Surprisingly, the ones who come to his aid are his uncle and Kousetsu—donning their dark and deadly ninja attire. \n\nAfter Ittoki is escorted to safety, his mother reveals the truth: he is the 19th heir to a noble clan of ninjas known as the Iga, and the target of assassination by their rival clan, the Koga. In order to protect himself against this new threat, Ittoki must hone his skills at the only ninja academy remaining in Japan: the Kokuten Ninja Academy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1476/125643.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/211080/Ittoki_Sakuraba","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/477921.jpg","name":"Sakuraba, Ittoki","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/15743/Ryouta_Oosaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/57323.jpg","name":"Oosaka, Ryouta"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/211082/Kousetsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/477920.jpg","name":"Kousetsu","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17629/Haruka_Shiraishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65614.jpg","name":"Shiraishi, Haruka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/211081/Tokisada_Kaga","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/477919.jpg","name":"Kaga, Tokisada","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/20/Katsuyuki_Konishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/69727.jpg","name":"Konishi, Katsuyuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/211083/Yumika_Sakuraba","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/477922.jpg","name":"Sakuraba, Yumika","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/195/Kikuko_Inoue","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69603.jpg","name":"Inoue, Kikuko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/212674/Ryouko_Suzunone","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/477924.jpg","name":"Suzunone, Ryouko","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/58395/Hitomi_Sekine","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/66101.jpg","name":"Sekine, Hitomi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/212650/Kirei_Kisegawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/477923.jpg","name":"Kisegawa, Kirei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67808.jpg","name":"Yuuki, Aoi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/212644/Satomi_Tsubaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/477925.jpg","name":"Tsubaki, Satomi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39149/Miyu_Tomita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/67315.jpg","name":"Tomita, Miyu"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/214446/Kidou_Minobe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/482187.jpg","name":"Minobe, Kidou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/591/Kenjirou_Tsuda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/63379.jpg","name":"Tsuda, Kenjirou"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/217055/Enya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/487069.jpg","name":"Enya","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/26181/Masashi_Nogawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/70480.jpg","name":"Nogawa, Masashi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/217054/Nishina_Amadeus_Yoshinaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/487068.jpg","name":"Yoshinaka, Nishina Amadeus","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39126/Hiroki_Maeda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/41850.jpg","name":"Maeda, Hiroki"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/48669/Shuu_Watanabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Watanabe, Shuu","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8074/Jin_Aketagawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/53380.jpg","name":"Aketagawa, Jin","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/58217/Minato_Takano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Takano, Minato","role":"Script, Series Composition"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/59982/Humbreaders","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/70520.jpg","name":"Humbreaders","role":"Theme Song Performance"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ChhpLcr-z58?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Shinobi no Ittoki","japaneseTitle":"忍の一時","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Oct 4, 2022 to Dec 20, 2022","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Tuesdays at 20:00 (JST)","producers":["TMS Entertainment","Toy's Factory","DMM pictures","DMM Music","NetEase","Vobile Japan"],"studios":["TROYCA"],"source":"Original","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

Nicknamed \"Sugimoto the Immortal\" for his death-defying acts in battle, the ex-soldier seeks fortune in order to fulfill a promise made to his best friend before he was killed in action: to support his family, especially his widow who needs treatment overseas for her deteriorating eyesight. One day, a drunken companion tells Sugimoto the tale of a man who murdered a group of Ainu and stole a fortune in gold. Before his arrest by the police, he hid the gold somewhere in Hokkaido. The only clue to its location is the coded map he tattooed on the bodies of his cellmates in exchange for a share of the treasure, should they manage to escape and find it.\n\nSugimoto does not think much of the tale until he discovers the drunken man's corpse bearing the same tattoos described in the story. But before he can collect his thoughts, a grizzly bear—the cause of the man's demise—approaches Sugimoto, intent on finishing her meal. He is saved by a young Ainu girl named Asirpa, whose father happened to be one of the murdered Ainu. With Asirpa's hunting skills and Sugimoto's survival instincts, the pair agree to join forces and find the hidden treasure—one to get back what was rightfully her people's, and the other to fulfill his friend's dying wish.\n\n[Written by MAL

Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor.\n\nThe brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy, Winry creates prosthetic limbs for Edward by utilizing \"automail,\" a tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. After years of training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange.\n\nAs Edward becomes an infamous alchemist and gains the nickname \"Fullmetal,\" the boys' journey embroils them in a growing conspiracy that threatens the fate of the

Although each of them possesses significant talents, they also display characteristics that detract from their potential—including Hitamu's extreme clumsiness and Hanabata's unintentional perverseness.\n\nAs if there was not enough to deal with, the monsters outside Mebuki's walls start exhibiting odd behavior by targeting women salaciously, causing the party endless problems in more ways than one.

These raccoon dogs, who are able to transform into human beings, used to love fooling humans until advanced technology rendered their endeavors futile. However, Mameda, a young tanuki girl, has not given up on this tradition, and—resolved to follow in her father's footsteps—travels to Osaka in hopes of duping people.\n\nAs others in her village predicted, Mameda fails to deceive a single person, and she is even hunted down by an angry crowd. After finding refuge in a theater, she stumbles upon a rakugo performance given by a master of the art, Bunko Daikokutei. Fascinated by the vivid images created by the rakugoka's acting, Mameda becomes enamored with this style of storytelling and decides to become Bunko's apprentice!\n\nDespite her initial reluctance to take a disciple, Bunko begins to teach Mameda rakugo after witnessing the young tanuki's perseverance. Between undertaking a taiko apprenticeship, handling her work at the theater, and memorizing plays, Mameda needs to give her all if she ever plans to master the only art that still has a chance to

Managed by the nefarious entertainment executive Ryou Tsukumo, they will stop at nothing to get their way, resorting to all kinds of underhanded tactics to bring down their rivals. TRIGGER's image has already been ruined by scandal, and IDOLiSH7 and Re:vale are headed for the same fate—or worse.\n\nMeanwhile, Zero, the legendary idol who disappeared 15 years ago, continues to haunt the present through those he left behind. His manager seems to be in contact with Tsukumo for his own schemes, and Zero's songwriter reveals himself in a letter after having been missing for years. IDOLiSH7 finds an ally in Re:vale to thwart ŹOOĻ's plans while trying to make sense of Zero's colleagues' actions, but it may be impossible for everyone to emerge unscathed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1458/125998.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133485/Riku_Nanase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/291828.jpg","name":"Nanase, Riku","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/819/Kensho_Ono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61244.jpg","name":"Ono, Kensho"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133489/Sougo_Ousaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/291824.jpg","name":"Ousaka, Sougo","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/991/Atsushi_Abe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54612.jpg","name":"Abe, Atsushi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133486/Iori_Izumi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/368870.jpg","name":"Izumi, Iori","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/12017/Toshiki_Masuda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/60807.jpg","name":"Masuda, Toshiki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133487/Mitsuki_Izumi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/291827.jpg","name":"Izumi, Mitsuki","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/556/Tsubasa_Yonaga","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/56775.jpg","name":"Yonaga, Tsubasa"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133490/Tamaki_Yotsuba","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/291822.jpg","name":"Yotsuba, Tamaki","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/857/KENN","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/60780.jpg","name":"KENN"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133488/Nagi_Rokuya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/291825.jpg","name":"Rokuya, Nagi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/7695/Takuya_Eguchi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67736.jpg","name":"Eguchi, Takuya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133491/Yamato_Nikaidou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/291823.jpg","name":"Nikaidou, Yamato","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/19641/Yuusuke_Shirai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65169.jpg","name":"Shirai, Yuusuke"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133750/Ten_Kujou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/291829.jpg","name":"Kujou, Ten","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/18227/Souma_Saitou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/52218.jpg","name":"Saitou, Souma"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/133752/Gaku_Yaotome","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/291831.jpg","name":"Yaotome, Gaku","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/98/Wataru_Hatano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/64697.jpg","name":"Hatano, Wataru"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/142523/Momose_Sunohara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/308350.jpg","name":"Sunohara, Momose","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/30/Souichirou_Hoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/44478.jpg","name":"Hoshi, Souichirou"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17645/Makoto_Bessho","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/72132.jpg","name":"Bessho, Makoto","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/36682/Takatoshi_Hamano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Hamano, Takatoshi","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47939/Yoriko_Tomita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Tomita, Yoriko","role":"Script"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/7695/Takuya_Eguchi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67736.jpg","name":"Eguchi, Takuya","role":"Theme Song Performance"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Au9jYd7qOH0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"IDOLiSH7 Third BEAT!
