That's when Anisphia concocts a plan to help Euphyllia regain her good name-which somehow involves them living together and researching magic!

cost him that reality. Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1258/126929.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178716/Meguru_Bachira","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/498284.jpg","name":"Bachira, Meguru","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/55082/Tasuku_Kaito","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/64773.jpg","name":"Kaito, Tasuku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/177491/Yoichi_Isagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/498285.jpg","name":"Isagi, Yoichi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/52590/Kazuki_Ura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61058.jpg","name":"Ura, Kazuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178712/Hyouma_Chigiri","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/498286.jpg","name":"Chigiri, Hyouma","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/18227/Souma_Saitou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/52218.jpg","name":"Saitou, Souma"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178718/Rensuke_Kunigami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/498283.jpg","name":"Kunigami, Rensuke","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1154/Yuuki_Ono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62831.jpg","name":"Ono, Yuuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178722/Seishirou_Nagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/498287.jpg","name":"Nagi, Seishirou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/10989/Nobunaga_Shimazaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/70961.jpg","name":"Shimazaki, Nobunaga"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/188026/Rin_Itoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/498288.jpg","name":"Itoshi, Rin","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1764/Kouki_Uchiyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63405.jpg","name":"Uchiyama, Kouki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178723/Shouei_Barou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/498289.jpg","name":"Barou, Shouei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/95/Junichi_Suwabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/66059.jpg","name":"Suwabe, Junichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178719/Reo_Mikage","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/498290.jpg","name":"Mikage, Reo","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/33995/Yuuma_Uchida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/71413.jpg","name":"Uchida, Yuuma"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178715/Jinpachi_Ego","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/498291.jpg","name":"Ego, Jinpachi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/118/Hiroshi_Kamiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66163.jpg","name":"Kamiya, Hiroshi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178721/Sae_Itoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/498292.jpg","name":"Itoshi, Sae","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/79/Takahiro_Sakurai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62791.jpg","name":"Sakurai, Takahiro"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63582/Makoto_Furukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Furukawa, Makoto","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/53860/Tetsuaki_Watanabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Watanabe, Tetsuaki","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37118/Fumiyuki_Gou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63242.jpg","name":"Gou, Fumiyuki","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/62538/Masao_Kawase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Kawase, Masao","role":"Episode Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4V_e3iRxds?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Blue Lock","japaneseTitle":"ブルーロック","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"24","aired":"Oct 9, 2022 to ?","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Sundays at 01:30 (JST)","producers":["TV Asahi","Kodansha","Toy's Factory","Crunchyroll","Bandai Spirits","Bit grooove promotion","Bandai Namco Filmworks","Bandai Namco Music Live"],"studios":["8bit"],"source":"Manga","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.\n\nBut instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world—one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker \"Shadow\" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1874/121869.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/171572/Cid_Kagenou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/461218.jpg","name":"Kagenou, Cid","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/23249/Seiichirou_Yamashita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/41764.jpg","name":"Yamashita, Seiichirou"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194185/Delta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/483020.jpg","name":"Delta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/49011/Ai_Fairouz","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65931.jpg","name":"Fairouz, Ai"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194178/Alpha","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/491824.jpg","name":"Alpha","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11787/Asami_Seto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65840.jpg","name":"Seto, Asami"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194179/Beta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/491826.jpg","name":"Beta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/65498.jpg","name":"Minase, Inori"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194192/Claire_Kagenou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/486844.jpg","name":"Kagenou, Claire","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/5250/Rina_Hidaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/64321.jpg","name":"Hidaka, Rina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194186/Epsilon","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/483024.jpg","name":"Epsilon","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8555/Hisako_Kanemoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/53110.jpg","name":"Kanemoto, Hisako"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194180/Gamma","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/483023.jpg","name":"Gamma","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11359/Suzuko_Mimori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73413.jpg","name":"Mimori, Suzuko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/206345/Zeta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/483019.jpg","name":"Zeta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/25773/Ayaka_Asai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/60997.jpg","name":"Asai, Ayaka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/206346/Eta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/483018.jpg","name":"Eta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/33795/Reina_Kondou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69580.jpg","name":"Kondou, Reina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/194194/Alexia_Midgar","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/499326.jpg","name":"Midgar, Alexia","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69318.jpg","name":"Hanazawa, Kana"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63590/Shouta_Watase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Watase, Shouta","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/55494/Kazuya_Nakanishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Nakanishi, Kazuya","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8074/Jin_Aketagawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/53380.jpg","name":"Aketagawa, Jin","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/42034/Daisuke_Takashima","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Takashima, Daisuke","role":"Episode Director, Storyboard"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-3fre7943U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"The Eminence in Shadow","japaneseTitle":"陰の実力者になりたくて！","synonyms":["Shadow Garden"],"type":"TV","episodes":"20","aired":"Oct 5, 2022 to ?","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Wednesdays at 22:30 (JST)","producers":["AT-X","BS NTV","Kadokawa","NewGin","Aiming"],"studios":["Nexus"],"source":"Light novel","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"R -

In fact, Shiraishi's lack of presence is so severe that people think his seat in class is always empty, and mistakenly assume that he often skips school. There is even a weird rumor spreading around in class, claiming that those who successfully spot Shiraishi will be blessed with good fortune for the day.\n\nSo far, the only person who notices his existence is Nagisa Kubo, the girl seated next to him. Unfortunately for him though, Kubo likes to tease him on a daily basis and often puts him into unprecedented and nerve-wracking situations. However, as Kubo's playful antics continue to involve the reluctant Shiraishi, he may soon discover that his youth might not be as boring as he initially thought. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1818/132330.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/179622/Nagisa_Kubo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/473602.jpg","name":"Kubo, Nagisa","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69318.jpg","name":"Hanazawa, Kana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/179024/Junta_Shiraishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/473601.jpg","name":"Shiraishi, Junta","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/15877/Kengo_Kawanishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63509.jpg","name":"Kawanishi, Kengo"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/183858/Seita_Shiraishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/495980.jpg","name":"Shiraishi, Seita","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/655/Mariya_Ise","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/43187.jpg","name":"Ise, Mariya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/190789/Akina_Kubo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/493275.jpg","name":"Kubo, Akina","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/24413/Miku_Itou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67955.jpg","name":"Itou, Miku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/192771/Unzen-sensei","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/495981.jpg","name":"Unzen-sensei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1522/Naoki_Tatsuta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/33099.jpg","name":"Tatsuta, Naoki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/196598/Saki_Kubo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/493276.jpg","name":"Kubo, Saki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21517/Sora_Amamiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/64457.jpg","name":"Amamiya, Sora"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/218845/Yoshie_Shiraishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/495979.jpg","name":"Shiraishi, Yoshie","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/40/Mamiko_Noto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/44269.jpg","name":"Noto, Mamiko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/208158/Hazuki_Kudou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/493277.jpg","name":"Kudou, Hazuki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/18511/Ai_Kakuma","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65855.jpg","name":"Kakuma, Ai"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/208157/Tamao_Taira","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/493278.jpg","name":"Taira, Tamao","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/68581.jpg","name":"Taketatsu, Ayana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/223518/Mai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Mai","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/45241/Tomoyo_Takayanagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63637.jpg","name":"Takayanagi, Tomoyo"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/36979/WEST_GROUND","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/43720.jpg","name":"WEST GROUND","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63682/Jianli_Yang","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Yang, Jianli","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63683/Takuji_Wada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Wada, Takuji","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63681/Nobuaki_Takahashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Takahashi, Nobuaki","role":"Producer"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaVsFCj1gAs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible","japaneseTitle":"久保さんは僕を許さない","synonyms":["Kubo-san wa Boku wo Yurusanai","Kubo-san Doesn't Leave Me Be (a Mob)"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jan 10, 2023 to ?","premiered":"Winter 2023","broadcast":"Tuesdays at 21:30 (JST)","producers":["Pony Canyon","AT-X","Tokyo MX","Glovision","Shueisha","bilibili","Kadokawa"],"studios":["Pine Jam"],"source":"Manga","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot.

Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment.\n\nKiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible.\n\nWhile class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86830.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128909/Kiyotaka_Ayanokouji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/439784.jpg","name":"Ayanokouji, Kiyotaka","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37562/Shouya_Chiba","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/69338.jpg","name":"Chiba, Shouya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128910/Suzune_Horikita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/314058.jpg","name":"Horikita, Suzune","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/34951/Akari_Kitou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/68020.jpg","name":"Kitou, Akari"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/152098/Kei_Karuizawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/349510.jpg","name":"Karuizawa, Kei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/68581.jpg","name":"Taketatsu, Ayana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/152154/Arisu_Sakayanagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/467334.jpg","name":"Sakayanagi, Arisu","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/5250/Rina_Hidaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/64321.jpg","name":"Hidaka, Rina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128917/Honami_Ichinose","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/314065.jpg","name":"Ichinose, Honami","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11184/Nao_Touyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61307.jpg","name":"Touyama, Nao"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/152151/Airi_Sakura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/336748.jpg","name":"Sakura, Airi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/25437/Mao_Ichimichi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/56420.jpg","name":"Ichimichi, Mao"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/152155/Kakeru_Ryuuen","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/492380.jpg","name":"Ryuuen, Kakeru","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/41752/Masaaki_Mizunaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/71149.jpg","name":"Mizunaka, Masaaki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128918/Sae_Chabashira","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/314066.jpg","name":"Chabashira, Sae","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/241/Rina_Satou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/63995.jpg","name":"Satou, Rina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128911/Kikyou_Kushida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/314059.jpg","name":"Kushida, Kikyou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17209/Yurika_Kubo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69339.jpg","name":"Kubo, Yurika"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128915/Rokusuke_Kouenji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/314063.jpg","name":"Kouenji, Rokusuke","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21425/Toshiki_Iwasawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/50097.jpg","name":"Iwasawa, Toshiki"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63455/Mitsuhiro_Ogata","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Ogata, Mitsuhiro","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63484/Shou_Tanaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Tanaka, Shou","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6909/Seiji_Kishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/49711.jpg","name":"Kishi, Seiji","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/27147/Hiroyuki_Hashimoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/34969.jpg","name":"Hashimoto, Hiroyuki","role":"Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYsx6w5PNno?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Classroom of the Elite","japaneseTitle":"ようこそ実力至上主義の教室へ","synonyms":["Welcome to the Classroom of the Elite","You-jitsu"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jul 12, 2017 to Sep 27, 2017","premiered":"Summer 2017","broadcast":"Wednesdays at 23:30 (JST)","producers":["Studio Hibari","Lantis","Media Factory","AT-X","Sony Music Communications","Toranoana","Crunchyroll","Kadokawa Media House","AKABEiSOFT2"],"studios":["Lerche"],"source":"Light novel","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.\n\nIn preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This \"lack\" of common knowledge renders him the academy's outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.\n\n[Written by MAL

But as the girl shows no plans to stop teasing her senpai, it is only a matter of time before they realize how they truly feel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1902/129579.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/157797/Hayase_Nagatoro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/439273.jpg","name":"Nagatoro, Hayase","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/14441/Sumire_Uesaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65562.jpg","name":"Uesaka, Sumire"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/157798/Naoto_Hachiouji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/439248.jpg","name":"Hachiouji, Naoto","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21971/Daiki_Yamashita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/57424.jpg","name":"Yamashita, Daiki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/169210/Maki_Gamou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/441784.jpg","name":"Gamou, Maki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/10071/Mikako_Komatsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/69581.jpg","name":"Komatsu, Mikako"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/183809/Sana_Sunomiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/497328.jpg","name":"Sunomiya, Sana","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/81/Nana_Mizuki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54694.jpg","name":"Mizuki, Nana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/167278/Yoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/441785.jpg","name":"Yoshi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/36461/Aina_Suzuki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62963.jpg","name":"Suzuki, Aina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/171309/Sakura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/441786.jpg","name":"Sakura","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/16453/Shiori_Izawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/70387.jpg","name":"Izawa, Shiori"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/187152/Misaki_Nagatoro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/491260.jpg","name":"Nagatoro, Misaki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1592/Yoshino_Nanjou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/64836.jpg","name":"Nanjou, Yoshino"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/197554/Hana_‎Sunomiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/491261.jpg","name":"‎Sunomiya, Hana","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/48122/Sayumi_Suzushiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61303.jpg","name":"Suzushiro, Sayumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/219111/Orihara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/491262.jpg","name":"Orihara","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/48147/Kaori_Maeda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/64448.jpg","name":"Maeda, Kaori"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/223398/Kaichou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/499631.jpg","name":"Kaichou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/29667/Haruki_Ishiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63442.jpg","name":"Ishiya, Haruki"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63585/Hiroshi_Kamei","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73493.jpg","name":"Kamei, Hiroshi","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/9813/Shinji_Ushiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/7677.jpg","name":"Ushiro, Shinji","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8074/Jin_Aketagawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/53380.jpg","name":"Aketagawa, Jin","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/14441/Sumire_Uesaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65562.jpg","name":"Uesaka, Sumire","role":"Theme Song Performance"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DbTbFCkIdss?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro 2nd Attack","japaneseTitle":"イジらないで、長瀞さん 2nd Attack","synonyms":["Don't Toy with Me","Miss Nagatoro 2nd Season","Ijiranaide","Nagatoro-san 2nd Season"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jan 8, 2023 to ?","premiered":"Winter 2023","broadcast":"Sundays at 01:00 (JST)","producers":["TMS Entertainment","Mainichi Broadcasting System","Kodansha","King Records"],"studios":["OLM"],"source":"Manga","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

Naming her in-game character Maple, she sets out on her journey. As a complete novice to such games, she allocates all of her stat points into vitality, desiring to not get hurt. With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can't move quickly or hit hard.\n\nThis doesn't end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills such as Total Defense, Poison Immunity, and Devour. These skills, along with the incredibly powerful items she obtains, allow her to obliterate most enemies in a single hit. After only a few days of playing the game, Maple claims third place in a server-wide event, gaining a reputation as a player who is both unkillable and absurdly powerful.\n\nDespite her overpowered character, Kaede has much to learn. As she progresses through the game, she meets new friends and acquaintances, helping her complete new levels and events. Through all of her adventures, she may even pick up some other crazy skills that exceed all expectations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1579/113812.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/174332/Maple","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/396709.jpg","name":"Maple","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/38659/Kaede_Hondo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/71414.jpg","name":"Hondo, Kaede"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/174333/Sally","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/396710.jpg","name":"Sally","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/41974/Ruriko_Noguchi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/67597.jpg","name":"Noguchi, Ruriko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/179993/Syrup","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/417029.jpg","name":"Syrup","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47364/Miyuri_Shimabukuro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63638.jpg","name":"Shimabukuro, Miyuri"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/176748/Kanade","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/460665.jpg","name":"Kanade","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/124/Satomi_Arai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65143.jpg","name":"Arai, Satomi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/176747/Kasumi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/396698.jpg","name":"Kasumi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/869/Saori_Hayami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/73488.jpg","name":"Hayami, Saori"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/181286/Mii","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/406813.jpg","name":"Mii","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/241/Rina_Satou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/63995.jpg","name":"Satou, Rina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/176752/Iz","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/396708.jpg","name":"Iz","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6560/Satomi_Satou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65775.jpg","name":"Satou, Satomi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/176750/Yui","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/396706.jpg","name":"Yui","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39548/Nanaka_Suwa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/42463.jpg","name":"Suwa, Nanaka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/176749/May","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/396704.jpg","name":"May","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/18511/Ai_Kakuma","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65855.jpg","name":"Kakuma, Ai"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/176751/Kuromu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/396707.jpg","name":"Kuromu","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/16/Noriaki_Sugiyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73289.jpg","name":"Sugiyama, Noriaki"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63780/Kazusa_Umeda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Umeda, Kazusa","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63774/Kentarou_Inoue","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Inoue, Kentarou","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/62993/Hayato_Kaneko","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/61707.jpg","name":"Kaneko, Hayato","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63779/Kenichi_Tokumura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/73676.jpg","name":"Tokumura, Kenichi","role":"Producer"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AODnWIirajU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"BOFURI: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense.","japaneseTitle":"痛いのは嫌なので防御力に極振りしたいと思います。","synonyms":["I hate being in pain","so I think I'll make a full defense build.","I Hate Getting Hurt","So I Put All My Skill Points Into Defense"],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jan 8, 2020 to Mar 25, 2020","premiered":"Winter 2020","broadcast":"Wednesdays at 22:00 (JST)","producers":["AT-X","MAGES.","Docomo Anime Store","Sammy","ABC Animation","Kadokawa Media House","Kadokawa","D-techno"],"studios":["SILVER LINK."],"source":"Light novel","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

As is the case for any supernatural problem, Kotoko and her partner set out to stop this spirit from wreaking havoc—but this case may prove to be far more sinister and personal than they could have ever thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1310/117188.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128943/Kotoko_Iwanaga","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/419755.jpg","name":"Iwanaga, Kotoko","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/34951/Akari_Kitou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/68020.jpg","name":"Kitou, Akari"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128944/Kurou_Sakuragawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/399724.jpg","name":"Sakuragawa, Kurou","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/65/Mamoru_Miyano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66414.jpg","name":"Miyano, Mamoru"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/160206/Saki_Yumihara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/391593.jpg","name":"Yumihara, Saki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/207/Misato_Fukuen","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/64813.jpg","name":"Fukuen, Misato"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/182462/Rikka_Sakuragawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/493709.jpg","name":"Sakuragawa, Rikka","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1673/Mayumi_Saco","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/11644.jpg","name":"Saco, Mayumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/174703/Karin_Nanase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/391591.jpg","name":"Nanase, Karin","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/14441/Sumire_Uesaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65562.jpg","name":"Uesaka, Sumire"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/205841/Steel_Lady_Nanase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/464078.jpg","name":"Steel Lady Nanase","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/182463/Aoi_Tanio","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/409550.jpg","name":"Tanio, Aoi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/45590/Manami_Hanawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/55932.jpg","name":"Hanawa, Manami"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/174704/Detective_Terada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/391592.jpg","name":"Detective Terada","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/371/Kenji_Hamada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/56373.jpg","name":"Hamada, Kenji"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/205862/Machii_Yoshikazu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Yoshikazu, Machii","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/205858/Komainu_Shiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/464099.jpg","name":"Komainu (Shiro)","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/2307/Keiji_Gotou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/43210.jpg","name":"Gotou, Keiji","role":"Director, Episode Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/35729/Haru_Yamada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/53573.jpg","name":"Yamada, Haru","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/28655/Shizutaka_Sugahara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Sugahara, Shizutaka","role":"Episode Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/49733/Risako_Yoshida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Yoshida, Risako","role":"Episode Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O47qukJbNHc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"In/Spectre","japaneseTitle":"虚構推理","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jan 12, 2020 to Mar 29, 2020","premiered":"Winter 2020","broadcast":"Sundays at 01:30 (JST)","producers":["Nihon Ad Systems","Kodansha","KlockWorx","Docomo Anime Store","King Records","Crunchyroll","GYAO!","BS NTV","Marui Group"],"studios":["Brain's Base"],"source":"Manga","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"R -

The \"lucky\" person selected happens to be the lustful and unlucky high schooler Ataru Moroboshi. Given 10 days to attempt to grab Lum's horns, Ataru realizes how impossible the challenge is as he is faced with Lum's extraterrestrial powers.\n\nMotivated by a promise of marriage from his childhood friend Shinobu Miyake, Ataru manages to catch Lum off guard. He mistakenly grabs hold of her bikini top first, but he eventually achieves his true goal. Although the game is over, Lum misunderstands that she is the one whom Ataru wants to marry, and she decides to move in with him.

To further this goal, he keeps his identity as the Iceblade Magician a secret, the scars of the past still haunting him to this very day.\n\nDespite being ostracized for being a commoner, Ray befriends the prideful yet kind Amelia Rose, the muscle-brained Evy Armstrong, and the shy and bookish Elisa. However, conspiracy is lurking in the academy walls, and Ray is tasked with hunting down a spy whose motives remain unclear.

Triangle","synopsis":"Matsuri Kazamaki and Suzu Kanade are childhood friends, bonded by their shared ability to see ayakashi—youkai in search of a life force to devour. However, in high school, their relationship deteriorates. As Suzu's one-sided feelings are growing, so is the difference in their ayakashi views: Matsuri considers all ayakashi a threat to his friend, while Suzu is an ayakashi medium—someone who exudes a significant amount of life force compared to the average human—and loves them all despite the risk.\n\nWhen the two stumble upon a talking white cat named Shirogane, they are unaware that it is a four-hundred-year-old ayakashi known as the \"King of Ayakashi.\" He is hell-bent on gaining even more power by devouring Suzu, but as Matsuri swoops in to try and save her by sealing Shirogane's powers, the ayakashi uses a jutsu to turn him into a girl instead!\n\nMatsuri vows to protect Suzu from further harm as her best friend, but he must learn how to act like a girl until his grandfather—a famous wind jutsu exorcist ninja—can undo the jutsu. Meanwhile, Suzu must work out her romantic feelings for Matsuri now that he is no longer a boy. But when Matsuri takes the king as his pet, the future of the two friends seems uncertain.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1078/131921.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/187356/Suzu_Kanade","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/499757.jpg","name":"Kanade, Suzu","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47097/Kana_Ichinose","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/70398.jpg","name":"Ichinose, Kana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/187355/Matsuri_Kazamaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/497198.jpg","name":"Kazamaki, Matsuri","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37562/Shouya_Chiba","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/69338.jpg","name":"Chiba, Shouya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/186394/Shirogane","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/497200.jpg","name":"Shirogane","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/761/Tesshou_Genda","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54780.jpg","name":"Genda, Tesshou"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/186399/Soga_Ninokuru","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/497203.jpg","name":"Ninokuru, Soga","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/44664/Shouya_Ishige","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/64266.jpg","name":"Ishige, Shouya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/186398/Lucy_Tsukioka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/497202.jpg","name":"Tsukioka, Lucy","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/40903/Hina_Kino","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/43887.jpg","name":"Kino, Hina"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/186397/Yayoi_Toba","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/497201.jpg","name":"Toba, Yayoi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/890/Haruka_Tomatsu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/63378.jpg","name":"Tomatsu, Haruka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/224282/Yasaka-sama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Yasaka-sama","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39129/Nao_Fujita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/41854.jpg","name":"Fujita, Nao"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/224283/Run","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Run","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/935/Fuyuka_Ono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54692.jpg","name":"Ono, Fuyuka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/223822/Tadare","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/500895.jpg","name":"Tadare","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/16959/Itaru_Yamamoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/56711.jpg","name":"Yamamoto, Itaru"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/224284/Suzu_039_s_Mother","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Suzu's Mother","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1133/Harumi_Sakurai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/54041.jpg","name":"Sakurai, Harumi"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63638/Mao_Higashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73522.jpg","name":"Higashi, Mao","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37589/Noriaki_Akitaya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/66875.jpg","name":"Akitaya, Noriaki","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8074/Jin_Aketagawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/53380.jpg","name":"Aketagawa, Jin","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39149/Miyu_Tomita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/67315.jpg","name":"Tomita, Miyu","role":"Theme Song Performance"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxT64PeYeXk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"","japaneseTitle":"あやかしトライアングル","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jan 10, 2023 to ?","premiered":"Winter 2023","broadcast":"Tuesdays at 01:00 (JST)","producers":["Aniplex","Yomiuri Telecasting","Chugai Mining","Shueisha","BS11","Marui Group"],"studios":["Connect"],"source":"Manga","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"R+ -

However Aichi is in a different high school than most of his friends, a high school where the instructors focus on looking towards the future. One day Aichi admits he thinks Cardfight can be a future people can believe in, but in order to prove it Aichi must use his new deck, a deck in which Royal Paladins and Gold Paladins are combined as one force. Slowly but surely Aichi must gain friends through Cardfighting and help his new team win the newly formed high school cardfighting championships.\n\n(Source: ANN)","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1229/125014.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/39539/Aichi_Sendou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/155017.jpg","name":"Sendou, Aichi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/556/Tsubasa_Yonaga","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/56775.jpg","name":"Yonaga, Tsubasa"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/39494/Misaki_Tokura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/289040.jpg","name":"Tokura, Misaki","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/7899/Izumi_Kitta","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/55656.jpg","name":"Kitta, Izumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/40427/Kourin_Tatsunagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/110163.jpg","name":"Tatsunagi, Kourin","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11359/Suzuko_Mimori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73413.jpg","name":"Mimori, Suzuko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/77827/Naoki_Ishida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/289391.jpg","name":"Ishida, Naoki","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1659/Tooru_Nara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/53891.jpg","name":"Nara, Tooru"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/82377/Shingo_Komoi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/295204.jpg","name":"Komoi, Shingo","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/283/Hiroyuki_Yoshino","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/66077.jpg","name":"Yoshino, Hiroyuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/39492/Toshiki_Kai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/108002.jpg","name":"Kai, Toshiki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/9580/Takuya_Satou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/71349.jpg","name":"Satou, Takuya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/44292/Ren_Suzugamori","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/253829.jpg","name":"Suzugamori, Ren","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/991/Atsushi_Abe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54612.jpg","name":"Abe, Atsushi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/39589/Taishi_Miwa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/107998.jpg","name":"Miwa, Taishi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/178/Shoutarou_Morikubo","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66440.jpg","name":"Morikubo, Shoutarou"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/40693/Emi_Sendou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/118793.jpg","name":"Sendou, Emi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/411/Atsuko_Enomoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/16599.jpg","name":"Enomoto, Atsuko"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/83413/Kenji_Mitsusada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/204533.jpg","name":"Mitsusada, Kenji","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/7512/Kenji_Akabane","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/71097.jpg","name":"Akabane, Kenji"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8146/Hatsuki_Tsuji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/43590.jpg","name":"Tsuji, Hatsuki","role":"Director, Storyboard"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8185/Takeshi_Takadera","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/54100.jpg","name":"Takadera, Takeshi","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/61239/Shuuhei_Arita","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Arita, Shuuhei","role":"Episode Director, Key Animation"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39940/Kurasumi_Sunayama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Sunayama, Kurasumi","role":"Script"}],"englishTitle":"Cardfight!!
