[{"title":"Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsunomanika Dame Ningen ni Sareteita Ken","synopsis":"Mahiru Shiina is worthy of her nickname \"Angel\": she is a divine beauty loved by all, and she excels in both academics and athletics. Shiina lives in an entirely different world from Amane Fujimiya, her next-door neighbor. Despite living so close together, they have never spoken once. But their silence is broken when Fujimiya spots Shiina gloomily sitting on a swing amidst a heavy rainstorm and lends her his umbrella. \n\nWhen Fujimiya catches a cold the next day, Shiina wishes to return the favor for the umbrella by nursing him back to health. Believing that this would be their first and last interaction, he silently appreciates her kindness. However, Shiina—who can not help but worry about Fujimiya's lack of tidiness and proper nutrition—begins to cook and clean for him. As the unlikely pair spend time together in Fujimiya's apartment, they explore the true nature of their relationship and the gentle emotions that emerge from it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1240/133638.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/193569/Mahiru_Shiina","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/461554.jpg","name":"Shiina, Mahiru","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/44317/Manaka_Iwami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/67682.jpg","name":"Iwami, Manaka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/193568/Amane_Fujimiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/468197.jpg","name":"Fujimiya, Amane","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47739/Taito_Ban","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/56682.jpg","name":"Ban, Taito"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/198133/Chitose_Shirakawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/468198.jpg","name":"Shirakawa, Chitose","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17629/Haruka_Shiraishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65614.jpg","name":"Shiraishi, Haruka"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/198132/Itsuki_Akazawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/468199.jpg","name":"Akazawa, Itsuki","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/38359/Taku_Yashiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61056.jpg","name":"Yashiro, Taku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/198134/Yuuta_Kadowaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/504308.jpg","name":"Kadowaki, Yuuta","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/819/Kensho_Ono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61244.jpg","name":"Ono, Kensho"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/198135/Shihoko_Fujimiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/501255.jpg","name":"Fujimiya, Shihoko","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/8555/Hisako_Kanemoto","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/53110.jpg","name":"Kanemoto, Hisako"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/223359/Shuuto_Fujimiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/502351.jpg","name":"Fujimiya, Shuuto","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/17635/Makoto_Furukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/72232.jpg","name":"Furukawa, Makoto"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/225189/Sayo_Shiina","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Shiina, Sayo","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/31/Mai_Nakahara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/54693.jpg","name":"Nakahara, Mai"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63613/Yasushi_Miwa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Miwa, Yasushi","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63608/Fumi_Miura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Miura, Fumi","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63607/Hirotaka_Kaneko","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/73504.jpg","name":"Kaneko, Hirotaka","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63614/Jun_Satou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Satou, Jun","role":"Producer"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUq59ARXtdg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten","japaneseTitle":"お隣の天使様にいつの間にか駄目人間にされていた件","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jan 7, 2023 to Mar 25, 2023","premiered":"Winter 2023","broadcast":"Saturdays at 22:30 (JST)","producers":["Pony Canyon","Movic","TOHO animation","Tokyo MX","Good Smile Company","Pia","SB Creative"],"studios":["Project No.9"],"source":"Light novel","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","genres":["Comedy","Romance"],"status":"Currently Airing","score":"7.95","scoreStats":"scored by 28,202 users","ranked":"#651","popularity":"#1326","members":"160,334","favorites":"1,759","id":50739,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/50739/Otonari_no_Tenshi-sama_ni_Itsunomanika_Dame_Ningen_ni_Sareteita_Ken"},{"title":"Tensei Oujo to Tensai Reijou no Mahou Kakumei","synopsis":"Princess Anisphia \"Anis\" Wynn Palletia has always dreamed of flying through the sky, even though the people of her kingdom consider it a silly ambition. Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing \"magicology\" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth.\n\nDue to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard. Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée. After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fiancée as a bully.\n\nAfter crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing. She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to. Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllia's company.\n\n[Written by MAL

Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1258/126929.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178716/Meguru_Bachira","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/498284.jpg","name":"Bachira, Meguru","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/55082/Tasuku_Kaito","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/64773.jpg","name":"Kaito, Tasuku"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/177491/Yoichi_Isagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/498285.jpg","name":"Isagi, Yoichi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/52590/Kazuki_Ura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/61058.jpg","name":"Ura, Kazuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178712/Hyouma_Chigiri","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/498286.jpg","name":"Chigiri, Hyouma","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/18227/Souma_Saitou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/52218.jpg","name":"Saitou, Souma"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178718/Rensuke_Kunigami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/498283.jpg","name":"Kunigami, Rensuke","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1154/Yuuki_Ono","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62831.jpg","name":"Ono, Yuuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178722/Seishirou_Nagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/498287.jpg","name":"Nagi, Seishirou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/10989/Nobunaga_Shimazaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/70961.jpg","name":"Shimazaki, Nobunaga"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/188026/Rin_Itoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/498288.jpg","name":"Itoshi, Rin","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1764/Kouki_Uchiyama","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63405.jpg","name":"Uchiyama, Kouki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178723/Shouei_Barou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/498289.jpg","name":"Barou, Shouei","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/95/Junichi_Suwabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/66059.jpg","name":"Suwabe, Junichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178719/Reo_Mikage","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/498290.jpg","name":"Mikage, Reo","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/33995/Yuuma_Uchida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/73526.jpg","name":"Uchida, Yuuma"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178715/Jinpachi_Ego","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/498291.jpg","name":"Ego, Jinpachi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/118/Hiroshi_Kamiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66163.jpg","name":"Kamiya, Hiroshi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/178721/Sae_Itoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/498292.jpg","name":"Itoshi, Sae","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/79/Takahiro_Sakurai","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62791.jpg","name":"Sakurai, Takahiro"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63582/Makoto_Furukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Furukawa, Makoto","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/53860/Tetsuaki_Watanabe","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Watanabe, Tetsuaki","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/37118/Fumiyuki_Gou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63242.jpg","name":"Gou, Fumiyuki","role":"Sound Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/62538/Masao_Kawase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Kawase, Masao","role":"Episode Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4V_e3iRxds?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Blue Lock","japaneseTitle":"ブルーロック","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"24","aired":"Oct 9, 2022 to ?","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Sundays at 01:30 (JST)","producers":["TV Asahi","Kodansha","Toy's Factory","Crunchyroll","Bandai Spirits","Bit grooove promotion","Bandai Namco Filmworks","Bandai Namco Music Live"],"studios":["8bit"],"source":"Manga","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -

As is the case for any supernatural problem, Kotoko and her partner set out to stop this spirit from wreaking havoc—but this case may prove to be far more sinister and personal than they could have ever thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1310/117188.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128943/Kotoko_Iwanaga","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/419755.jpg","name":"Iwanaga, Kotoko","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/34951/Akari_Kitou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/58704.jpg","name":"Kitou, Akari"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/128944/Kurou_Sakuragawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/399724.jpg","name":"Sakuragawa, Kurou","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/65/Mamoru_Miyano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66414.jpg","name":"Miyano, Mamoru"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/160206/Saki_Yumihara","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/391593.jpg","name":"Yumihara, Saki","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/207/Misato_Fukuen","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/64813.jpg","name":"Fukuen, Misato"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/182462/Rikka_Sakuragawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/493709.jpg","name":"Sakuragawa, Rikka","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/1673/Mayumi_Saco","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/11644.jpg","name":"Saco, Mayumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/174703/Karin_Nanase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/391591.jpg","name":"Nanase, Karin","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/14441/Sumire_Uesaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65562.jpg","name":"Uesaka, Sumire"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/205841/Steel_Lady_Nanase","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/464078.jpg","name":"Steel Lady Nanase","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/182463/Aoi_Tanio","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/409550.jpg","name":"Tanio, Aoi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/45590/Manami_Hanawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/55932.jpg","name":"Hanawa, Manami"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/174704/Detective_Terada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/391592.jpg","name":"Detective Terada","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/371/Kenji_Hamada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/56373.jpg","name":"Hamada, Kenji"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/205862/Machii_Yoshikazu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Yoshikazu, Machii","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/205858/Komainu_Shiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/464099.jpg","name":"Komainu (Shiro)","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"name":""}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63945/Fumihiro_Ozawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Ozawa, Fumihiro","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/64462/Nobuhiko_Kurosu","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Kurosu, Nobuhiko","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/2307/Keiji_Gotou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/43210.jpg","name":"Gotou, Keiji","role":"Director, Episode Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/35729/Haru_Yamada","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/53573.jpg","name":"Yamada, Haru","role":"Sound Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O47qukJbNHc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"In/Spectre","japaneseTitle":"虚構推理","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"12","aired":"Jan 12, 2020 to Mar 29, 2020","premiered":"Winter 2020","broadcast":"Sundays at 01:30 (JST)","producers":["Nihon Ad Systems","Kodansha","KlockWorx","Docomo Anime Store","King Records","Crunchyroll","GYAO!","BS NTV","Marui Group"],"studios":["Brain's Base"],"source":"Manga","duration":"24 min. per ep.","rating":"R -

To award him for his honorable achievements, the goddess Alistia appears and grants him one wish. Having never been able to master the blade, Inglis asks to be reincarnated in order to do so.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, Inglis finds himself born in the far future as a daughter of the Eucus noble family. Six years later, Inglis is discovered to be Runeless—incapable of utilizing the runes that enable the use of magic in this era. She is therefore ineligible to become a knight. However, this fits in well with Inglis' plan: she instead decides to become the squire for her cousin, Rafinha Bilford, allowing Inglis to focus on pushing her limits.\n\nFor Inglis, the challenges this familiar yet different world has to offer are instead opportunities for her to hone her skills—and possibly become an extraordinary squire in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL

The adult Takemichi grapples with grief and the ramifications of the Tokyo Manji gang's criminal empire—an unintended product of his timeline meddling. Though the gang once operated under the idealistic Manjirou \"Mikey\" Sano, it has now been taken over by the malicious Tetta Kisaki and, as a result, has abandoned its original optimistic intent.\n\nDespite feeling hopeless, Takemichi travels to the past once again to investigate Black Dragon, a rival motorcycle gang whose actions ultimately lead to Hinata's demise. There, he meets the young Hakkai Shiba, a fellow gang member whose older brother, Taiju, tyrannically rules Black Dragon. When Taiju brutally beats Takemichi in a one-sided street brawl, Hakkai attempts to withdraw from Tokyo Manji in apology—an act that Takemichi must prevent to spare Hakkai a grim future.\n\nThrough a shared tragedy, Takemichi bonds with Chifuyu Matsuno, establishing a close comradery both boys desperately need. With Chifuyu on his side, Takemichi works to unravel the fates of Black Dragon's members, fighting to create a happy future for his loved ones.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1773/132313.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/175294/Manjirou_Sano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/443690.jpg","name":"Sano, Manjirou","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/21157/Yuu_Hayashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/66487.jpg","name":"Hayashi, Yuu"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173221/Ken_Ryuuguuji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/451057.jpg","name":"Ryuuguuji, Ken","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/53787/Masaya_Fukunishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62734.jpg","name":"Fukunishi, Masaya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/171969/Takemichi_Hanagaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/397761.jpg","name":"Hanagaki, Takemichi","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/46833/Yuuki_Shin","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/73875.jpg","name":"Shin, Yuuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173212/Chifuyu_Matsuno","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/387987.jpg","name":"Matsuno, Chifuyu","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/47622/Shou_Karino","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/64562.jpg","name":"Karino, Shou"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173220/Keisuke_Baji","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/387998.jpg","name":"Baji, Keisuke","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/41752/Masaaki_Mizunaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/71149.jpg","name":"Mizunaka, Masaaki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173232/Takashi_Mitsuya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/388013.jpg","name":"Mitsuya, Takashi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/11817/Yoshitsugu_Matsuoka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/40132.jpg","name":"Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173219/Kazutora_Hanemiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/387997.jpg","name":"Hanemiya, Kazutora","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/38176/Shunichi_Toki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/60590.jpg","name":"Toki, Shunichi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173218/Hinata_Tachibana","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/441454.jpg","name":"Tachibana, Hinata","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/36812/Azumi_Waki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/62975.jpg","name":"Waki, Azumi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173230/Shuuji_Hanma","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/457022.jpg","name":"Hanma, Shuuji","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/7695/Takuya_Eguchi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67736.jpg","name":"Eguchi, Takuya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/173216/Nahoya_Kawata","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/397159.jpg","name":"Kawata, Nahoya","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/15877/Kengo_Kawanishi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/63509.jpg","name":"Kawanishi, Kengo"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/45782/Ryousuke_Naya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/49335.jpg","name":"Naya, Ryousuke","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/53642/Tetsurou_Satomi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Satomi, Tetsurou","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63585/Hiroshi_Kamei","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/73493.jpg","name":"Kamei, Hiroshi","role":"Producer"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/63582/Makoto_Furukawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Furukawa, Makoto","role":"Producer"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hfj7HaTbMSQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Tokyo Revengers: Christmas Showdown","japaneseTitle":"東京リベンジャーズ 聖夜決戦編","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"13","aired":"Jan 8, 2023 to ?","premiered":"Winter 2023","broadcast":"Sundays at 02:08 (JST)","producers":["Mainichi Broadcasting System","Pony Canyon","Kodansha","AT-X","Ultra Super Pictures","Studio Mausu","Sammy"],"studios":["LIDENFILMS"],"source":"Manga","duration":"23 min. per ep.","rating":"R -

The \"lucky\" person selected happens to be the lustful and unlucky high schooler Ataru Moroboshi. Given 10 days to attempt to grab Lum's horns, Ataru realizes how impossible the challenge is as he is faced with Lum's extraterrestrial powers.\n\nMotivated by a promise of marriage from his childhood friend Shinobu Miyake, Ataru manages to catch Lum off guard. He mistakenly grabs hold of her bikini top first, but he eventually achieves his true goal. Although the game is over, Lum misunderstands that she is the one whom Ataru wants to marry, and she decides to move in with him. The poor student constantly tries to shake off the clingy Lum while doing his best to reconcile with his desired fiancée. After Ataru's heroic feat results in such a disastrous outcome, it is questionable whether luck will ever be on his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1233/129144.jpg","characters":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/4835/Lum","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/498938.jpg","name":"Lum","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/14441/Sumire_Uesaka","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65562.jpg","name":"Uesaka, Sumire"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/4834/Ataru_Moroboshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/461388.jpg","name":"Moroboshi, Ataru","role":"Main","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/118/Hiroshi_Kamiya","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66163.jpg","name":"Kamiya, Hiroshi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/4836/Shuutarou_Mendou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/474083.jpg","name":"Mendou, Shuutarou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/65/Mamoru_Miyano","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/66414.jpg","name":"Miyano, Mamoru"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/18380/Ran","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/483386.jpg","name":"Ran","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/69318.jpg","name":"Hanazawa, Kana"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/4837/Shinobu_Miyake","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/474085.jpg","name":"Miyake, Shinobu","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/13639/Maaya_Uchida","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/68033.jpg","name":"Uchida, Maaya"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/3646/Ryuunosuke_Fujinami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/498935.jpg","name":"Fujinami, Ryuunosuke","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/823/Ayahi_Takagaki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/65611.jpg","name":"Takagaki, Ayahi"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/19104/Sakura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/474086.jpg","name":"Sakura","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/99/Miyuki_Sawashiro","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65500.jpg","name":"Sawashiro, Miyuki"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/17499/Sakuranbou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/474088.jpg","name":"Sakuranbou","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/133/Wataru_Takagi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/66813.jpg","name":"Takagi, Wataru"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/22390/Satoshi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/500393.jpg","name":"Satoshi","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/5222/Setsuji_Satou","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/57068.jpg","name":"Satou, Setsuji"}},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/character/12958/Ten","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/498940.jpg","name":"Ten","role":"Supporting","seiyuu":{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/67808.jpg","name":"Yuuki, Aoi"}}],"staff":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/41315/Hideya_Takahashi","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Takahashi, Hideya","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/39987/Yasuhiro_Kimura","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/61896.jpg","name":"Kimura, Yasuhiro","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/58109/Takahiro_Kamei","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.jpg","name":"Kamei, Takahiro","role":"Director"},{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/people/6016/Yoshikazu_Iwanami","picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/53607.jpg","name":"Iwanami, Yoshikazu","role":"Sound Director"}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhLF0pjMwns?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","englishTitle":"Urusei Yatsura","japaneseTitle":"うる星やつら","synonyms":[""],"type":"TV","episodes":"23","aired":"Oct 14, 2022 to ?","premiered":"Fall 2022","broadcast":"Fridays at 00:55 (JST)","producers":["Aniplex","Dentsu","Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","Fuji TV","Shogakukan","Fuji Creative"],"studios":["David Production"],"source":"Manga","duration":"22 min. per ep.","rating":"PG-13 -
